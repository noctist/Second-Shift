Installation and Locations for Linux version:

the project is in Second Shift/SecondShiftLinux
the exe is in the SecondShiftLinux/bin/Debug folder
need to install mono to run it: http://www.monogame.net/downloads/
and then in the terminal, write: mono SecondShiftLinux.exe
and that should (hopefully) launch it!



Gameplay:

Second Shift is a 2D side scroll beat em up in very early alpha stages. The core engine and multiplayer is functional but not relevant enough to be fully implemented.
Combat is simple and consists of controlling your main character in combat around the map. 


Controls:

Z to jump, X to attack, left/right to move.

Moving in a direction and attacking will have the player do a different combo.
