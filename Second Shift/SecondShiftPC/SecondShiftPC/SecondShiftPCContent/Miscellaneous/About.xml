  <Asset Type="System.String">This is the Second Shift Engine. This is not representative of the final game, and is simply made for testing.
  
You can test this app out by selecting different scenes, and changing the graphical quality in the options.
  
To move the character, just move your thumb around on the left side of the screen.
To jump, tap the right side of the screen. Wall jump by jumping while sliding down a wall.
To attack, swipe on the right side of the screen.
  
Note that this engine is still a work in progress, and you are likely to see severe performance issues. It will probably be made into a real game sometime in 2015 or 2016.
